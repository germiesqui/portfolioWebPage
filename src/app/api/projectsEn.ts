            <p class="gameDesc">The Tsar’s Secret is a 2.5D stealth game about infiltrating the Tsar’s palace. You can’t fight back, so the only way for succeeding is to outsmart your enemies and remain undiscovered. Use magic powers to blind or cause deafness in the palace guards, sneaking behind them and complete your mission.</p>

                    <div class="sectionBody">
                        <p>Of the two levels that this vertical slice has, I have made the design of the second one together with another colleague. One of the several rooms that I have designed has been this one that we can see in the image on the right.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>From the previous room we enter the corridor in Tenebris mode.</li>
                            <li>From the previous room we enter the corridor in Silentium mode.</li>
                            <li>Hidden corridor that allows you to skip part of the room. When you exit the previous room in Tenebris mode, your own wave illuminates this corridor.</li>
                            <li>Long corridor that allows you to analyze the puzzle of the next room as you advance. In Tenebris you can analyze the enemies, their routes and use the clock as a guide.</li>
                            <li>6. 7. The motivation of this room is to confront static enemies that stand on themselves looking to the sides. Taking advantage of the corners, you must advance in Silentium when he looks the other way, switch to Tenebris so he doesn't see you when he turns, and switch back to Silentium to advance on his side.</li>
                            <li>Clock as a visual and audible guide in both modes to show you the right way.</li>
                            <li>The distance from the stationary enemy to the wall is too short to walk past in Tenebris mode. The player must time the other patrolling enemy to go through the balcony on the right, switch to Tenebris and stay still so he doesn't get caught, and move forward once the enemy has continued his patrol.</li>

                        <p>When designing the levels we have taken into account 3 principles:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Force the player to use the 2 modes to overcome the various challenges.</li>
                            <li>Get the player to stop and analyze the challenge before trying to pass it.</li>
                            <li>Achieve a tight difficulty curve with intermediate peaks of difficulty and rest areas.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For the first principle we have included certain situations as we can see in the first gif on the right which is a part of a larger room with more interconnected challenges.</p>
                        <p>For the second principle we have adjusted the levels to force the player to use Tenebris or Silentium mode while walking close to the challenge from a safe position that allows him to analyze the level as he approaches it.</p>
                        <p>For the third principle we devised a difficulty curve separated by rooms in which we have intermediate peaks of increasing difficulty followed by rest areas and checkpoints strategically placed to increase or decrease the intensity of the zones.</p>

                        <p>During the initial phases of the project, we focused on closing and defining the core loop of the game and with it, the main mechanic: the mode change.</p>
                        <p>The game has two modes: Silentium and Tenebris. Each one fulfills a special function in solving the puzzles.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="bold">Silentium</span> allows us to see the level clearly, where exactly the enemies are, where they are looking and serves as a familiar resource to adapt to the game.<br/>But it has a problem, its range is short and does not allow us to see through walls.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Tenebris</span> works as an antithesis of the other mode. Nos permite "ver" a gran distancia, a través de las paredes pudiendo así analizar el puzle entero y encontrar los relojes que sirven de guia. It also allows us to pass unnoticed in the noses of an enemy, as long as we do not emit noise.<br/>Its downside, as we can see in the images, is that the structure of the level is not as clear as in Silentium and we have to look at the outline of the objects that draw the waves to guide us.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This mode change also affects the enemies, which change their detection mode depending on which mode you are in.</p>

                        <p>Combat is intended to put a slight twist on the Slay the Spire combat scheme. While <b>in Slay the Spire the strategy focuses on optimizing the current turn</b> with the cards you have available and knowing what the enemy is going to do next turn, <b>our game will incorporate a cross-combat strategy for the entire combat.</b></p>
                        <p>For this we will make you have 2 decks. These decks work similarly to those in Inscryption.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>We will have a <b>basic deck</b> that will allow us to generate resources immediately and will reward the player in the medium term if this card is used optimally. (<span class="italic">Ex: After using this card, you get 2 extra resource if in the next turn, the enemy inflicts damage on you.</span>)</p>
                            <li><p>We will have another <b>artifact deck</b>. This deck will contain the player's interesting actions that will serve mainly to attack or protect themselves. These cards consume resource that are NOT automatically regenerated as in Slay the Spire.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, artifact cards are single-use. This creates a dynamic to optimize the use of these cards and generates a post-combat card creation loop that ties in with the resource management system.</p>
                        <p>The intention is for the player to rely on the information of his cards in hand, the probability of his remaining cards to draw and his knowledge of enemy actions to form a long-term strategy (combat strategy).</p>
